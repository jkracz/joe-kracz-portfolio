# Portfolio Site

Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio site! It's a statically-generated, responsive web application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## About

This portfolio serves as a comprehensive space to learn more about me, my professional journey, and the projects I've been involved in. It's designed to provide a brief overview of my skills, experiences, and personal projects, as well as a way to get in touch with me.

## Features

-   **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.
-   **Static Generation**: Built using Next.js, the site is statically generated for optimal performance.
-   **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: The UI is designed with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Future Enhancements

I will be making periodic updates to the site, adding new projects, blog posts, and additional features.
