            <p className="text-xl mb-4">
                I'm a software engineer by education and have spent the last four years as a product manager in the
                fintech space. My experience in fast-paced startup environments has sharpened my problem-solving and
                stakeholder management skills, empowering me to drive impactful outcomes while defining both the "what"
                and the "why" of the products I build.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl mb-4">
                My multidisciplinary background equips me to excel not just in coding but also in understanding the
                broader impact of technology on business and user experience. My experience in leading cross-functional
                teams and my commitment to agile and engineering best practices allow me to bring ideas from conception
                to launch efficiently.

                I've been channeling these skills into causecompass.io, an initiative dedicated to bridging the gap
                between nonprofits and the communities they serve. Through the strategic use of technology and
                compelling storytelling, we aspire to highlight the unsung heroes and vital initiatives making a
                real-world impact.
